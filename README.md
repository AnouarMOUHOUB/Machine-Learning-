# Machine-Learning-

Welcome to my machine learning repository!

Here, I'll be sharing my latest work in the field of artificial intelligence and data science. Specifically, I'll be focusing on creating machine learning models from scratch, including supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as neural networks.

My goal is to provide clear and concise code samples that can help beginners understand the basics of machine learning, while also providing more advanced techniques for experienced practitioners.

In this repository, you'll find various projects that reflect my learning journey, including:

Regression models
Classification models
Clustering algorithms
Neural network architectures
Each project will be accompanied by detailed documentation explaining the methodology, code implementation, and results.

Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute to this repository. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, I hope you find something useful and interesting here.

If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for visiting, and happy learning!
